# Hi, I’m **elmanueh** 👋

**Software Engineer · BSc in Software Engineering · MSc Student**

I’m a **software engineer** focused on **software architecture** and building systems that scale well in both codebase and team productivity.  
What I enjoy most is applying **Clean Architecture**, designing **modular, well-defined boundaries**, and creating **reusable modules** (tooling, libraries, internal components) that make development smoother for the rest of the team.

I like working on problems where good architecture matters: maintainability, evolution over time, and clear separation of concerns—so shipping features stays fast and safe.

I work mainly on **backend systems**, designing and maintaining APIs and services in production environments. My experience includes working with **relational and non-relational databases** and integrating **message-based and event-driven systems** when asynchronous communication is required.
